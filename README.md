# Unified Robotics II Robot Arm C# Code
Source Code for the UI and Vision processing portion of UR2 Term Project


Launching the program and Run the Robot
----
Open the .stl and run as you would a normal C# program
Connect the external camera and select Camera under the Open tab at the top.
  P1-3 are just simple images that were used during the development of the code
  Make sure to orient the camera properly, more on that below
Connect the Arduino and select the serial port under the Open COM drop down
Enable the Run Robot check box
To begin the process, click the Home button
The Robot "should" now continue running until it runs out of shapes or the Run Robot checkbox was clicked again.
