# Unified Robotics II Robot Arm C# Code

Was having dificulties with VS: Most recent version is found under the Primary Branch

Overview
-
Design, Build, and Program a small robotic arm capable of locating, picking up, and sorting triangles and squares.

Source Code for the Vision Processing and UI elements of UR2 Term Project. These sections were programmed in Visual Studio using C#.

Additional resources can be found in the other repositories on my account.

Launching the program and Run the Robot
-
Open the .stl and run as you would a normal C# program

Connect the external camera and select Camera under the Open tab at the top.

=> P1-3 are just simple images that were used during the development of the code
  
=> Make sure to orient the camera properly, more on that below
  
Connect the Arduino and select the serial port under the Open COM drop down

Enable the Run Robot check box

To begin the process, click the Home button

The Robot "should" now continue running until it runs out of shapes or the Run Robot checkbox was clicked again.
